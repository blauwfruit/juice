# Juice: A CLI tool for upgrading PrestaShop

This tool provides a CLI interface for managing the entire upgrade process. With `juice/setup` you will be guided through the setup to make sure your upgrade runs smoothly.

We also make sure that you have a backup before upgrading with `juice/backup`. And we check the system requirements with `juice/check`.

## System requirements

You need to have the following installed:

- `curl`
- `rsync`
- `git` just to copy this repo, you can also download it via your browser

Read below how to install these.

## Recommended Database Maintenance Before Upgrade

Before running an upgrade, it is recommended to clean specific database tables to ensure the upgrade process is efficient and minimizes potential issues. Specifically, consider truncating the `ps_connections` and `ps_log` tables, which can grow large and affect performance. Hereâ€™s how you can clean these tables:

```bash
# Enter the database command line
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name

# Truncate tables
TRUNCATE TABLE ps_connections;
TRUNCATE TABLE ps_log;

# Exit the database command line
exit
```
## Getting started

Before you start, make sure you `cd` somewhere outside your application. This tool runs standalone.

```
mkdir juice && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/blauwfruit/juice.git .
find . juice -exec chmod 777 {} \;
```

Juice is now installed. You are ready to run the setup:

```
juice/setup
```

Once you finished this, you can run a backup:

```
juice/backup
```

Now we are ready to **upgrade**!

```
juice/upgrade
```

### Install hooks

To run custom scripts before and after the installation, run:

```bash
juice/install-hooks
```

This will place these files:

1. `blauwfruit-juice-upgrade-{$PRESTASHOP_NEW_VERSION}-hook-before` any in this file will run just before the upgrading process starts.
2. `blauwfruit-juice-upgrade-{$PRESTASHOP_NEW_VERSION}-hook-after` any in this file will run right after the application is successfully upgraded.

Hopefully you upgrade successfully!

## Brief summary of what happens

1. The code base will be replaced by the newer version 
2. The upgrade script of PrestaShop is called `upgrade.php`
3. Store the upgrade results inside `/results` so you can analyse what needs improvement

### Restore

If not, we can restore your old PrestaShop version:

```
juice/restore
```

# System requirements setup

```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git && apt-get install -y rsync
```

# Testing using Docker

We've included a Docker compose file for testing the upgrade feature. With this file we can install a new PrestaShop and test the upgrade.


1. **Install a new PrestaShop the preferred version**

```
export PS_VERSION=1.7.7.5 && docker compose up
```

Once that is up and running;

2. **Enter the container**

```
docker compose exec apache /bin/bash
```

4. **Go inside the juice folder**

```
cd ../juice
```
